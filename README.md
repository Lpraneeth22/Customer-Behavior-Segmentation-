🛍️ Customer Behavior Segmentation & Clustering Models

📌 Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior and demographic data to identify meaningful customer segments. By applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering, the project uncovers patterns that help businesses design targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation.

🎯 Business Objective

Segment customers based on spending habits, product preferences, and demographics.

Predict future purchasing trends using clustering insights.

Enable data-driven decision-making to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.

🔍 Key Steps

Data Collection & Validation: Imported customer dataset and validated data types, missing values, and duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis for deeper customer insights.

Visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Feature Engineering: Derived metrics for customer segmentation (e.g., total spend, age group).

Clustering Models Implemented:

K-Means

DBSCAN

Hierarchical Clustering

Model Evaluation: Compared cluster quality using Silhouette Score.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn

Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
